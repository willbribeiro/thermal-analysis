## Introduction

Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) are powerful techniques used to study thermal properties and behaviors of materials. TGA measures the change in mass of a sample as a function of temperature or time, providing insights into decomposition, volatilization, and other mass loss events. DSC measures the heat flow into or out of a sample as a function of temperature or time, enabling the investigation of phase transitions, reaction kinetics, and specific heat capacity.

This repository provides MATLAB and Octave scripts tailored for the analysis of TGA and DSC data, including:

- **Data preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess raw TGA and DSC data for analysis.
- **Thermal event detection**: Identify and characterize thermal events such as decomposition, volatilization, and phase transitions.
- **Kinetic analysis**: Determine reaction kinetics parameters, such as activation energy and reaction order, using various kinetic models.
- **Visualization**: Visualize TGA and DSC curves, thermograms, and kinetic analysis results.
